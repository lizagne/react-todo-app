To Do List React App

Create-react-app

Make folders in src
    components
    containers

Change the App.js file to just include your title for now

Start making the presentation components
    ToDoForm.js
    ToDoList.js
    ToDo.js

Then make the container components
    ToDoApp.js - where I will hold the initial state in a class Component, with constructor and super props.
